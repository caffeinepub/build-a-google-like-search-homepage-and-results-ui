# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Turn the existing app into a simple multi-page website experience with consistent navigation, layout, and styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Add client-side routing with a persistent header navigation linking at minimum to Home and Search.
- Create a website-style Home page with a hero section (headline + short description) and a primary CTA that routes into the existing Search flow.
- Add a consistent footer across main pages with basic links (Home, Search) and a short copyright line.
- Apply a single cohesive visual theme (typography, spacing, colors, and component styles) consistently across Home, Search Home, and Search Results, avoiding a blue/purple-dominant palette unless already present.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a Home page that explains the site, click a clear CTA to start searching, and navigate between Home and Search via a consistent header and footer on mobile and desktop without full page reloads.
